## 🌐 Vision

**Talkimon** is building the **foundational AI-to-Real-World Mesh Layer** — the *universal control rails* connecting **AI agents** to **physical systems** globally.

We believe the future belongs to **sovereign, open, and federated infrastructure** — not proprietary silos. Our goal is to establish the durable, trusted control layer for an **AI-augmented world**.

*This is the AI-to-Real-World Internet. Built to last. Built for all.*

---

## 🚀 Introduction

**Talkimon** defines a universal abstraction layer for connecting **AI agents** to **heterogeneous real-world actuators** across a **federated, secure mesh network**.

It enables **any AI**, from any vendor, to propose and execute **real-world actions** — while preserving **governance, auditability, and interoperability**.

**Human-friendly. Developer-friendly. Infra-grade.**

## 🚀 Core Concepts

| Concept                      | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| **Talkimon MeshNode**        | Device node that executes actions |
| **Talkimon CloudMesh**       | Global federation, directory, and control plane |
| **Driver**                   | Software controlling a device/actuator |
| **Action Proposal**          | AI-proposed action |
| **Canonical Action Vocabulary** | Official language of Mesh actions |
