## 🚀 Vision

> Build the **universal abstraction layer** for **AI → Real-World Actuators** — a secure, federated, unstoppable mesh.  
> The **rails** that all AI agents will run on.  
> An **irreplaceable $1B+ infrastructure layer** for the new AI-driven economy. 🚀

## 🎯 Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1 — MVP (COMPLETE ✅)

- [x] Full MeshNode → CloudMesh architecture
- [x] Core API endpoints (health, federation, governance)
- [x] Signed action proposals
- [x] Canonical action vocabulary
- [x] Federation state signing

---

### 🚀 Phase 2 — Hardening & Security

- [ ] End-to-end TLS
- [ ] Token-based / key-based auth for all endpoints
- [ ] Auditable action trails with external log store
- [ ] Governance voting mechanisms

---

### 🚀 Phase 3 — Scaling the Mesh

- [ ] Distributed federation registry
- [ ] Multi-cloud region support
- [ ] Dynamic node discovery
- [ ] Live mesh explorer dashboard

---

### 🚀 Phase 4 — Monetization & Billing

- [ ] API usage billing (credits / token model)
- [ ] Webhook event system
- [ ] Partner API licensing

---

### 🚀 Phase 5 — AI-Native UX

- [ ] Multi-AI agent collaboration protocols
- [ ] Real-time federated action proposals
- [ ] Autonomous Mesh AI agents

---

## 🛠️ Future Ideas

- AI Mesh SDK for other languages (Python, Go, Rust)
- AI Mesh CLI
- On-chain verifiable mesh state
- Governance via on-chain smart contracts
- Open Federation Protocol standard (public RFC)

**🌐 The Mesh will become the universal execution layer for AI.**  
**We are building the rails.** 🚀
